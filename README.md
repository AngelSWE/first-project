# first-project
This is going to be my first project for my SWE resume. This is a website I am looking to create for a local business that currently has no website. The website will integrate google maps so customers can find their location easily. This will also implement a google calender allowing the owner to have appointments auto-sync to his calendar and computer. They will be able to accept services and appointments through the site and allowing them to create a schedule to optimize time spent checking cars in.
